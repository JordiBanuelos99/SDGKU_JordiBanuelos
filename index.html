    <h3>Biography</h3>
    <!--This is a comment-->
    <p>Hello, my name is <b>Jordi Ba침uelos Mendez.</b> I was born in Tijuana in 1999 and have lived in this city most of my life. I'm currently <i>22 years old</i> and studying engineering informatics at the <mark>Technological Institute of Tijuana</mark> <ins>(or in spanish, Instituto Tecnol칩gico de Tijuana)</ins>, where I learned some of the basics in programming and coding in a <del>few platforms and languages</del> like <sub>C#, SQL and HTML,</sub> however, years have passed without me practicing, meaning that I lost a lot of knowledge, so this course will definitely help me extend my current knowledge and learn more besides school teachings. There may be a few challenges in my case, like having lost a lot of practice in both my <sup>english and coding knowledge,</sup> but hopefully these challenges will help me too.</p>
