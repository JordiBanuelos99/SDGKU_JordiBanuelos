                <p>Hello, my name is <b>Jordi Ba침uelos Mendez.</b> I was born in Tijuana in 1999 and have lived in this city most of my life. I'm currently <i>22 years old</i> and studying engineering informatics at the <mark>Technological Institute of Tijuana</mark> <ins>(or in spanish, Instituto Tecnol칩gico de Tijuana)</ins>, where I learned some of the basics in programming and coding in a <del>few platforms and languages</del> like <sub>C#, SQL and HTML,</sub> however, years have passed without me practicing, meaning that I lost a lot of knowledge, so this course will definitely help me extend my current knowledge and learn more besides school teachings. There may be a few challenges in my case, like having lost a lot of practice in both my <sup>english and coding knowledge,</sup> but hopefully these challenges will help me too.</p>
                <p>Like a lot of people of my generation, I grew up watching cartoons and television in general, using computers and a few other affordable technologies at the time to view, create or edit digital content. During my adolescence I dedicated more time to other activities like studying or playing soccer at school, although I kept my interest in the other activities. All these activities made me have a lot of interest in computer programming, multimedia editing, and even 3D modeling, even though I'm way too far from being an expert on all of them.</p>
